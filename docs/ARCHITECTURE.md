# Architecture

This document captures the **why** behind the architectural decisions for the
PAM (Player Admin Manager). What the code does is in the code; this document
exists for the decisions a future engineer can't recover from reading source.

## Modular monolith, not microservices (yet)

We build as a single deployable that is **internally** structured like a set
of services. Each module lives under `src/Modules/<Module>/Pam.<Module>/` with
its own `DbContext`, schema (`<module>.*`), aggregates, and feature folders.

- A module can be extracted to its own service when scale or team-org demands
  it. The module boundary (assembly, schema, contracts) makes that mechanical.
- Until then, we get a single deployable, one SQL Server backup, one connection
  pool, and zero distributed-system tax.

**Hard rule**: a module never reads another module's data or types directly.
The only way modules communicate is:

1. **Integration events** through MassTransit + RabbitMQ (default).
2. **In-process queries** through `IQuery<T>` interfaces in
   `Pam.<Module>.Contracts`.
3. Never via `DbContext` or direct project reference into `Pam.<Module>` from
   another module.

The contracts assembly is the seam. A future microservice extraction is
"replace the in-process implementation behind `IBrandLookup` with a gRPC
client" — same interface, different transport.

## Per-module pattern (established Phase 2)

Every module follows the same shape. `Pam.Operators` is the reference; copy
its scaffolding for module #2 and beyond.

**Three projects per module:**

- `Pam.<Module>.Contracts` — DTOs, `IQuery<T>` definitions, integration
  events. The only thing other modules and `Pam.Api` reference for
  cross-module reads.
- `Pam.<Module>` — aggregates, features (vertical slices), domain events,
  EF DbContext + migrations, module wire-up. Internal to the module.
- `tests/Pam.<Module>.UnitTests` — aggregate behavior + validator tests.
  No DB, no broker.

**Folder shape inside `Pam.<Module>`:**

```
<AggregateName>/
  Models/<Aggregate>.cs
  Features/<UseCase>/
    <UseCase>Command.cs
    <UseCase>Validator.cs
    <UseCase>Handler.cs
    <UseCase>Endpoint.cs
  Events/<DomainEvent>.cs
  EventHandlers/<DomainEvent>DomainHandler.cs   # bridges to integration event
  Exceptions/<Aggregate>Errors.cs
Data/
  <Module>DbContext.cs
  <Module>DbContextDesignTimeFactory.cs
  Configurations/<Aggregate>Configuration.cs
  Migrations/
<Module>Module.cs                                # AddXModule + UseXModuleAsync
```

**Module wire-up.** Static `<Module>Module` class with two extension
methods:

- `AddXModule(this IServiceCollection, IConfiguration)` — registers DbContext,
  interceptors, health checks.
- `UseXModuleAsync(this IServiceProvider)` — runs `db.Database.MigrateAsync()`
  on startup.

`AuditableSaveChangesInterceptor` and `DispatchDomainEventsInterceptor` (from
`Pam.Shared`) are registered per-module via `services.TryAddScoped<...>()` so
duplicate registrations across modules are idempotent.

**Persistence rules:**

- Schema-per-module via `modelBuilder.HasDefaultSchema("<module>")` and
  `sql.MigrationsHistoryTable("__EFMigrationsHistory", "<module>")` inside
  the `UseSqlServer(...)` options callback. SQL Server defaults the
  migrations history to `dbo`; routing it per-module keeps each schema
  self-describing.
- Snake_case columns via the `EFCore.NamingConventions` package
  (`options.UseSnakeCaseNamingConvention()`). Apply on **both** the runtime
  DbContext options and the design-time factory, or `dotnet ef migrations add`
  scaffolds PascalCase column names. The package is provider-agnostic — it
  rewrites column names regardless of the underlying engine.
- Enum columns persisted as string with `.HasConversion<string>().HasMaxLength(N)`.
  Keeps the column self-describing and makes adding values append-only at any
  ordinal position.
- Audit columns (`created_at`, `created_by_type`, `created_by_id`,
  `last_modified_*`) configured explicitly on every entity.

**Health check:** `services.AddHealthChecks().AddSqlServer(connectionString,
name: "<module>-db", tags: ["ready", "module:<module>"])`.

## Identity: embedded OpenIddict + ASP.NET Core Identity

PAM owns its identity stack. There is no external IDP process.

- **OpenIddict** (MIT, embedded as a NuGet package) issues OAuth 2.0 / OIDC
  tokens. Authorization Code + PKCE for the back-office SPA, refresh tokens
  with rotation, client_credentials pre-enabled for future module-to-module
  calls.
- **ASP.NET Core Identity** owns user storage, password hashing, lockout,
  email confirmation, MFA. Lives in the `Pam.Identity` module.
- **Single host, single SQL Server database.** Identity tables and OpenIddict
  tables cohabit `IdentityDbContext` in schema `identity`.
- **Roles + Permissions.** Identity provides `IdentityRole<Guid>` for coarse
  buckets (Owner, Manager, Operator, Accountant). On top of that, a
  `Permission` + `RolePermission` join carries fine-grained codes
  (`operators.read`, `players.write`, …). Both project as claims at
  token-issuance time; both can be referenced from `[Authorize(Policy = …)]`.

This is the "we own the entire code" answer. The tradeoff vs an external IDP
(ZITADEL/Keycloak) is more code we maintain in exchange for: no separate
process, no separate DB, no Brand↔Org sync layer, and any breaking change
hits us only on a deliberate package upgrade. See ADR #16.

`Pam.Identity` lands in Phase 3. Until then, every endpoint is anonymous —
intentional.

## Brand is a first-class aggregate in `Pam.Operators`

Multi-brand is a first-class concern: betanything.eu plus the planned LATAM
and Asia expansions all share this PAM.

- `Brand` (in `Pam.Operators`) owns name, slug (URL-safe identifier, unique
  per platform), jurisdiction (regulatory region), status (Active /
  Suspended / Disabled), and the audit columns. More fields land as the
  module grows (default currency, default language, brand metadata,
  jurisdictional policy refs).
- Every brand-scoped aggregate (Player, Wallet, Bonus, …) carries a
  `BrandId` foreign reference.
- Brand uniqueness is enforced at the DB (`UNIQUE (slug)`) and via an
  in-handler precheck so we can return a typed `AlreadyExistsException` (→
  409) instead of a SQL Server unique-violation generic 500.
- Brand resolution at runtime: anonymous registration takes brand context
  from a request header (final shape TBD when Players returns); back-office
  identities carry `brand_id` as a JWT claim issued by the embedded IDP.

When more brand-scoped modules ship, each `DbContext` will gain an EF Core
global query filter on `BrandId` to prevent the "forgot to filter by tenant"
data-leak class of bug.

## Lean integration events, no PII

Integration events carry IDs and routing data only — never email, name, DOB,
or anything else regulators would consider PII. Consumers that need richer
data go through the relevant `Pam.<Module>.Contracts` query (e.g.
`GetBrandByIdQuery`) to fetch it.

The reason is that integration events live in the message broker, the outbox
table, audit logs, and any consumer that listens. Putting PII into them
fans out PII to all of those stores and makes GDPR right-to-be-forgotten a
nightmare. Lean events are the regulated-finance default.

## Error model: ProblemDetails + stable string codes

All errors are RFC 7807 `ProblemDetails`. Domain exceptions carry a stable
string error code (`operators.brand.slug-taken`,
`operators.brand.not-found`, …) under `extensions.code`. Clients program
against the code; messages can be localized and tweaked freely.

Validation errors flow through FluentValidation and become
`ValidationProblemDetails` with a per-field error array.

Every response includes a `traceId` (W3C Activity ID) for support correlation.

## Endpoint annotations

Every Carter endpoint follows a single annotation pattern so Scalar
renders rich cards (summary, full description, request/response
schemas, every possible status code). The reference shape lives in
[`ENDPOINTS.md`](ENDPOINTS.md); the machine-enforced version is the
endpoint-conventions section of [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).

The mandatory chain: `WithTags` → `WithName` → `WithSummary` →
`WithDescription` (markdown) → `Accepts<T>` (for body) → typed
`Produces<T>` → every `ProducesProblem` the endpoint can actually
return → auth / rate-limit.

Anti-patterns blocked by code review: anonymous response types,
private nested request DTOs, declaring status codes the endpoint can't
produce.

## Time

`DateTimeOffset` everywhere, stored as `datetimeoffset`. `IClock` interface (with
`SystemClock` impl) is injected wherever a timestamp matters, so handlers and
domain code are testable.

`DateTime.Now`, `DateTime.UtcNow`, and `DateTimeOffset.Now` are banned via
`BannedSymbols.txt`. `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow` is allowed (intentional — used
by the `IntegrationEvent` base record's init defaults and similar places
where DI is impractical).

## Audit columns

`Entity<TId>` carries `CreatedAt`, `CreatedByType`, `CreatedById`,
`LastModifiedAt`, `LastModifiedByType`, `LastModifiedById`. The
`AuditableSaveChangesInterceptor` stamps these on every save using `IClock`
and `IUserContext`.

`IUserContext.Current` returns a typed `Actor(ActorType, Id)` — never null,
defaulting to `Actor.System` for background work and `Actor.Anonymous` for
unauthenticated requests. `ActorType ∈ {System, Player, Operator, Service,
Anonymous}`. The Phase 3 `Pam.Identity` `CurrentUserService` will populate
this from JWT claims (user id + a discriminator derived from the issuing
audience or scope set).

This is the regulator-checkable discriminator: a `Player` self-suspending vs
an `Operator` suspending them are distinguishable in the audit columns
without parsing.

This is application audit logging, not regulatory audit logging. Regulatory
audit (immutable, cryptographically chained) is a separate `Pam.Audits`
module that subscribes to integration events. It will arrive when there's a
real regulatory requirement to satisfy.

## Domain events vs integration events

Two distinct concerns:

| Domain event | Integration event |
|---|---|
| Inside one module | Across modules |
| `Pam.<Module>/<Concept>/Events/` | `Pam.<Module>.Contracts/<Concept>/IntegrationEvents/` |
| Internal — refactor freely | Public contract — versioned, breaking changes are real |
| Dispatched in-process by `DispatchDomainEventsInterceptor` (post-save) | Outbox + MassTransit (when consumers arrive) |
| Naming: `BrandCreated` | Naming: `BrandCreatedIntegrationEvent` |

Domain events do not implement MediatR's `INotification`. They implement our
own `IDomainEvent`. A wrapper (`DomainEventNotification<TEvent>`) adapts them
for MediatR dispatch. This keeps the domain free of framework types.

A handler inside the module bridges the two: e.g.
`BrandCreatedDomainHandler` listens to `BrandCreatedDomainEvent` (in
`Pam.Operators`) and publishes `BrandCreatedIntegrationEvent` (from
`Pam.Operators.Contracts`) via MassTransit's `IPublishEndpoint`. The
integration event preserves the original `EventId` and `OccurredAt`.

### Integration events describe what happened, not what to do

Single most important rule for shaping an integration event. The publisher
broadcasts a fact (`UserLoggedIn`, `PlayerRegistered`, `BetSettled`).
Subscribers decide what to do with it.

The trap is publishing a "command-shaped" event:

```csharp
// WRONG — this is RPC dressed up as an event
public sealed record SendEmailIntegrationEvent(
    string To, string Subject, string Body
) : IntegrationEvent;
```

That couples the publisher to:
- the recipient's email + locale (whose data?)
- the email body wording (whose template?)
- whether to send at all (whose policy?)
- per-brand branding (where does it live?)

…and it leaks PII through every queue and audit log it touches.

```csharp
// RIGHT — describe the fact, leave the action to subscribers
public sealed record UserLoggedInIntegrationEvent(
    Guid UserId,
    string IpAddress,
    string UserAgent,
    string? DeviceFingerprint
) : IntegrationEvent;
```

`Pam.Notifications` (when it ships) subscribes, queries Identity for the
user's contact + locale, decides if the login warrants an email, renders
the template, and only *then* enqueues a send-email job. The publisher
stays ignorant of all that.

### Integration events vs job queues — both ride RabbitMQ

Two different patterns, both transported by MassTransit/RabbitMQ.

|  | Integration event | Job queue |
|---|---|---|
| Question | "What happened?" | "When can this work run?" |
| Producer | Notifies the world | Schedules work |
| Consumers | Many — fan-out broadcast | One worker per job |
| Caller waits? | No (fire-and-forget) | Sometimes (poll for status) |
| Retry/scheduling? | Optional | Core feature |
| Coupling | Decouples *modules* from each other | Decouples *time of request* from *time of work* |

A typical flow chains them:

```
1. POST /v1/identity/login                 (synchronous, ~50ms)
   ├── validate, sign in, set cookie
   ├── publish UserLoggedInIntegrationEvent
   └── return 204
                                           (RabbitMQ exchange)
                                                  ↓
2. Pam.Notifications.UserLoggedInConsumer  (cross-module subscriber)
   ├── query Identity for user contact + locale
   ├── apply policy ("first IP this week? new device?")
   ├── render template
   └── enqueue SendEmail job
                                           (RabbitMQ queue)
                                                  ↓
3. EmailSender worker                      (internal job consumer)
   ├── call SES / SendGrid / SMTP
   ├── retry on failure with exponential backoff
   └── dead-letter after N failures
```

Step 1 is synchronous — the user is waiting. Step 2 is the integration
event (decouple modules). Step 3 is the job queue (decouple work from
time, with retries). Three concerns, one broker.

### What gets queued vs what stays synchronous

Rule of thumb: anything where the user is waiting for the result of a
*decision* runs synchronously. Anything that's a side effect of that
decision runs async.

| Operation | Pattern | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /login` | Synchronous | User waiting; cookie in response |
| `POST /register` | Synchronous | Validation must reject immediately |
| `POST /reset-password` | Synchronous | Validation + token; returns 200 |
| Sending the welcome email | Queued | SMTP can fail; needs retries |
| Sending an SMS via Twilio | Queued | Rate-limited downstream API |
| Webhook to a game provider | Queued | Retry until 200 or dead-letter |
| Bulk-importing players from `gbs-db` | Queued | Long-running |
| Generating a daily revenue report | Queued | Heavy aggregation |
| Real-time bet placement | Synchronous | <50ms latency budget |

Returning 202 Accepted with a job id is occasionally the right call —
mostly for genuinely long-running operations the user explicitly
initiated (a CSV import). It's almost never the right call for a user
action with a yes/no decision behind it.

## Notifications and cross-module email

`Pam.Notifications` is the only module that owns an SMTP gateway
(`IEmailSender` + the MailKit-backed `SmtpEmailSender`). The interface
ships in `Pam.Notifications.Contracts`; every other module that needs
to send mail injects it from there. Two paths into the gateway, used
for different shapes of need:

### Path 1 — direct `IEmailSender.SendAsync(...)`

Use this when the **publisher owns the content** AND **the payload is
sensitive enough that putting it on the broker is a bad idea**.

Concrete example: `Pam.Identity`'s `ForgotPasswordHandler` calls
`IEmailSender` directly. The handler has the user, generates the reset
token, embeds it in the link, and sends — all inside one transaction.
The token IS the credential. Putting it in a `PasswordResetRequested-
IntegrationEvent` would fan it out to every consumer's logs, the outbox
table, the audit trail, and any future regulatory-audit subscriber. That
isn't acceptable for a thing that grants access to an account.

The other intra-module sends in Identity (email confirmation, MFA admin
reset notifications when those land) follow the same pattern.

### Path 2 — publish a fact-shaped integration event

Use this for **cross-module** flows where the originating module
*shouldn't* know the template, the recipient's locale, the brand
styling, or even whether an email is the right channel.

```
Pam.Players  ──publish──▶  PlayerRegisteredIntegrationEvent(PlayerId, BrandId)
                                              │
                                         (RabbitMQ)
                                              │
Pam.Notifications  ──consume──▶  PlayerRegisteredEmailConsumer
                                  ├─ query Pam.Players.Contracts.IPlayerLookup
                                  │     for email + locale + display name
                                  ├─ pick template for (brand, locale)
                                  ├─ render
                                  └─ IEmailSender.SendAsync(...)
```

The event is lean (just IDs). The consumer in `Pam.Notifications/
Consumers/` decides whether to send, picks the template, renders it,
and calls `IEmailSender`. This is the right shape for: Players welcome
email, Wallet deposit confirmation, Bonuses awarded, KYC verified,
suspicious-login alerts, etc.

### Why split this way

If every module imported `IEmailSender` and inlined templates, you'd
end up with:
- Email body wording scattered across N modules.
- Per-brand branding duplicated everywhere.
- Locale resolution duplicated everywhere.
- Compliance review needing to audit N modules instead of 1.

Funneling cross-cutting "we observed X, the user should probably be
told" through integration events keeps all template + branding +
delivery policy in one place — `Pam.Notifications`. The originating
module just describes what happened.

The two-path split is the same architectural principle that makes
integration events fact-shaped (see *Integration events describe what
happened, not what to do* above). The direct-call path is the carved-out
exception for "the publisher genuinely does own the content because it
owns the secret."

## Aggregate sizing rules

Three rules, repeat in code review:

1. One command modifies one aggregate in one transaction. If a command needs
   two, the boundary is wrong or you need a saga.
2. Reference other aggregates by ID, never by navigation property.
3. Default to small aggregates. Merge only when an invariant requires atomic
   writes across them.

## Secrets

Two-layer model:

1. **Non-secret config** (URLs, log levels, feature flags) lives in
   `appsettings.{env}.json`, committed.
2. **Secrets** (DB connection strings, RabbitMQ passwords, OpenIddict
   signing/encryption keys, payment-provider HMACs) arrive as environment
   variables from the host. ASP.NET's default configuration precedence
   reads env vars over `appsettings.{env}.json` and treats `__` as the
   nesting separator (`ConnectionStrings__Pam` →
   `ConnectionStrings:Pam`).

In production those env vars are injected by whatever orchestrator runs the
API — systemd unit, k3s Secret, Swarm secret. The orchestrator-managed
secret model is sufficient for the current deployment shape; a dedicated
secret store (HashiCorp Vault, SOPS, k3s External Secrets, ...) is an open
question pinned in `ROADMAP.md` and will be evaluated when the first real
production deploy lands.

## Outbox + pre-save domain-event dispatch

Domain events dispatch **pre-save**: `DispatchDomainEventsInterceptor`
overrides `SavingChangesAsync` so handlers run inside the business
`SaveChanges` of the module that triggered them. The dispatch loop is
bounded at 8 generations to catch handlers that recursively raise
events on tracked aggregates.

**Outbox topology (single shared messaging schema).** MassTransit 8.5.x
can attach the bus outbox to one DbContext only — `IScopedBusContextProvider<IBus>`
is keyed on the bus type, so the multi-DbContext outbox available in
MT 9.1 isn't on the table while PAM holds the Apache-2.0 line. PAM
uses one `PamMessagingDbContext` (schema `messaging`, in
`Pam.Shared.Messaging`) that owns `inbox_state` / `outbox_state` /
`outbox_message`. `AddPamMassTransit` calls `UseBusOutbox()` on this
one context. Module DbContexts (Operators, Ingest, Wallet, ...) do NOT
carry outbox entities and modules do NOT register their own outboxes.
See DECISIONS.md ADR #26 for the full rationale and the citation to
the MT author's endorsement of this pattern.

The publish flow:

1. Command handler runs, writes to its module's business DbContext,
   calls `SaveChangesAsync`. `DispatchDomainEventsInterceptor` fires
   pre-save, dispatches domain events via MediatR.
2. Bridge handler (e.g. `BrandCreatedDomainHandler`,
   `TransactionIngestedDomainHandler`) calls
   `IPublishEndpoint.Publish(<integration event>)`.
3. The bus-wide outbox intercepts the publish and writes an
   `OutboxMessage` row into `PamMessagingDbContext`'s change tracker.
4. The business `SaveChangesAsync` completes — only business rows
   committed; outbox rows still in-memory in the messaging change
   tracker.
5. `OutboxFlushBehavior` (innermost MediatR pipeline behavior) calls
   `messaging.SaveChangesAsync` at the command tail. Outbox rows
   commit to `messaging.outbox_message`.
6. `BusOutboxNotification` immediately wakes
   `BusOutboxDeliveryService<PamMessagingDbContext>`; the delivery
   service publishes to RabbitMQ and removes the delivered rows.

Trade-offs you're buying into:

- Handlers see **pre-commit** state of the business DbContext. The
  aggregate row isn't visible to other connections yet, so a handler
  that queries the DB for freshly-written data will miss it.
  Workaround: pass the data through the event payload.
- A throwing handler **rolls back the whole business `SaveChanges`**.
  That's the point — atomic by design. Don't put best-effort side
  effects (logging, metrics) in a domain handler; put them in an
  integration-event consumer.
- **Atomicity caveat (covered by the reconciler).** The business
  `SaveChanges` and the outbox `SaveChanges` run in separate
  transactions. A crash between them leaves the business row committed
  but the integration event undelivered — sub-millisecond under-deliver
  window. We tried closing it with a shared `SqlConnection` +
  `IDbContextTransaction` across the business and messaging DbContexts;
  it broke when handlers query the DB before calling `SaveChanges` (EF
  Core opens the context's connection independently of the ambient
  transaction, then `UseTransaction` fails with "transaction is not
  associated with the current connection"). MT 8.5's
  one-DbContext-per-bus constraint also rules out the canonical
  per-module-outbox fix; MT 9.1's multi-DbContext outbox is off-limits
  per the Apache-2.0 license pin (ADR #5). See DECISIONS.md ADR #28.
- **Reconciler closes the practical gap.** Each publishing module's
  bridge handler writes an `outbox_dispatched_log` row (in the messaging
  context's change tracker) in the same dispatch path as
  `IPublishEndpoint.Publish`. The two rows commit together via
  `OutboxFlushBehavior`'s single `messaging.SaveChangesAsync`, giving
  *atomicity within the outbox tier*. Business rows whose dispatched-log
  entry is missing get republished on the next sweep of
  `OutboxReconciliationService` (`IHostedService`, 5-min default).
- The `messaging.outbox_message` table is **empty in steady state**
  — that's correct outbox semantics: the delivery service removes
  delivered rows. Use the API log's `Flushed N outbox row(s)` debug
  line or the RabbitMQ exchange list to verify activity, not a SELECT
  against the table.

**Adding a new publisher** = define a domain event, write a bridge
handler that calls `IPublishEndpoint.Publish` with an integration
event record. No outbox plumbing, no `ConfigureOutbox` method, no
package references — the bus-wide outbox in `Pam.Shared.Messaging`
already covers it.

**For Wallet** the outbox is non-negotiable from day one of that module —
the wallet's `LedgerEntryPosted` integration event MUST be transactional
with the ledger row. The shared-messaging-DbContext pattern is the
substrate that makes it possible without per-module wiring.
